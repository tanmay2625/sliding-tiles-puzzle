A course project in Artificial Intelligence course.

This is a NxM sliding tiles puzzle solver for N, M <= 6. It uses different search techniques for different puzzle sizes and is capable of producing fast (worst case : 5 mins) optimal solutions till N, M <= 4. For bigger puzzles, it produces fast, suboptimal solutions. The details can be found in the attached report.


Dependencies : C++, Python3, pygame

Clone the repo and run :

python3 auto.py

After you provide the input and choose the search technique/heuristic, a window will open and show the live demo of how to slide the empty tile to attain the destination configuration.
